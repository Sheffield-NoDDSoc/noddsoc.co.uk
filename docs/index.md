# Welcome to the NoDDSoc Website!

This is the new home for NoDDSoc news and information. 
Over the 2025/26 academic year, we'll be phasing out our information channels on Discord in favour of this website.
This is to make sure everything is accessible in one place, and we hope it'll make it easier for you to find the information you need.

## What can you do here?

We created this website to be a central hub for all the information related to our society and its activities.
You can use it to find information about:

- Our games and events
- Safety tools, etiquette and our inclusions policy
- Books available in the [online library](/library)
- Committee members and their roles
- The latest news and announcements in our [weekly newsletter](/newsletter/category/weekly-newsletter)

## Finding information

Our website is split into three main sections:

- The knowledge base, which contains loads of information about NoDDSoc
- The news section, which is home to our weekly newsletter and other announcements
- The online library, where you can find all the books we have available and request loans

You can navigate between these sections using the menu at the top of the page on desktop, or in the hamburger menu on mobile.

We want to make sure this website is as useful as possible, so if you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know.
