# GM Resources

NoDDSoc (as the name suggests) welcomes all TTRPG systems, with some of the most popular being:

- DnD 5e
- Pathfinder
- Call of Cthulhu

We're always looking for more GMs to run games for the society, so if you're interested then please feel free to get involved!

## Running a Campaign

Campaigns tend to run for the full academic year, and are in very high demand. We collect a list of campaigns from GMs at the beginning of the academic year, as well as players' preferences for each, then assign each campaign a set of players.

You can register to run a campaign by [filling in this form][forms.campaign].

### Replacing/Adding Players

If your campaign is already running but needs more players, then please post a message in `#looking-for-game` on the [Social Server][discord.social] with the details of the campaign. You can ping the `@Looking for Games` role to alert members who are currently looking for games.

## Running a One-Shot

If you want to run a one-shot for NoDDSoc, please [fill in this form][forms.one_shot]. You'll be asked to fill in various details about the game you wish to run, as well as when you want to run it. 

If you've asked to run the one-shot in person, we'll contact you at your preferred method with a room booking once we've sorted one for you. If you've chosen to run it online, we'll setup a channel for you in the [Games Server][discord.games].

## Other Resources

Please see [the GM Masterlist][resources.gm_masterlist] for a series of additional resources made specifically to help GMs.
