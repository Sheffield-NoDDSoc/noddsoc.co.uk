# Playing a Game

!!! note
    This section is intended for players who wish to play a game under NoDDSoc.

    There is a separate guide for GMs who wish to run a game under NoDDSoc, which can be found [here](/games/running_a_game).

Always ensure you have read and understood our [player etiquette guide][etiquette.player] before playing a game in NoDDSoc.

## When and Where?

Most of our games run every Wednesday evening from 6pm to 10pm during term time. 
The majority of our games will be held in the Gallery in the Students' Union, but you may be given a private room if requested by anyone in your group.
Some games may also run on other days of the week, or at different times, so please check with your GM if you're unsure.

## Joining a Game

Our games mostly run through the academic year, and almost everyone is allocated a game at the start of the year. 
We call this process the player signups, and we'll let you know when it opens through our [Discord server][discord.social] and our [weekly newsletter](/newsletter). 

If you don't manage to join a game at the beginning of the year, fear not! 
Our GMs will often post in `#looking-for-game` on the [Social server][discord.social] if they have spare places in their games, or if they are looking for new players to join their game. 
We also have one-shots that run every now and then, which are a great way to try out a new system or genre without committing to a full campaign.

## Session Zero

Session Zero is the first session of a campaign. 
It's a chance for you to meet your GM and fellow players, discuss the game and safety tools, and create your characters together.
