# Running a Game

!!! note
    This section is intended for GMs who wish to run a game under NoDDSoc.

    There is a separate guide for players who wish to play a game under NoDDSoc, which can be found [here](/games/playing_a_game).

At the beginning of each academic year, we'll send out a form on our [Discord server][discord.social] asking GMs to submit their campaign proposals.
We call this the GM signups process.

Always ensure you have read and understood our [GM etiquette guide][etiquette.gm] before running a game under NoDDSoc.

## Review and Approval Process

Once you've proposed your game to the Committee, it'll then be reviewed by our [Inclusions team](/committee/members) to ensure it meets our safety standards. 
If your game contains sensitive or harmful content, it may be classified as Yellow or Red, which will affect how we handle it. 
We classify games as follows:

| Classification | Description                                                                                                                   | Actions                                                    |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Red            | This game contains bigoted ideals, or uses a system in which bigoted ideals are incorporated in a way that cannot be avoided. | This game cannot be run within NoDDSoc.                    |
| Yellow         | This game discusses or contains sensitive content (e.g. racism, sexual violence, etc).                                        | You may be asked to limit or remove the sensitive content. |
| Green          | There are no inclusions concerns with this game.                                                                              | This game can run as is.                                   |

After the Inclusions team has reviewed your game, they will either approve it (if it is a Green game), or ask you to make changes/clarify certain aspects (if it is a Yellow game). 
If your game is classified as Red, you will not be able to run it within NoDDSoc.

## Player Selection

Once your game has been approved, we will offer it to players through our yearly signup process that comes shortly after our GM signups close. 
If you already have players (e.g. you're continuing a campaign from the previous year), please let us know so we can ensure their places are reserved.

### Replacing Players

Should a player need to be replaced (or you wish to have more players), you can post a message in `#looking-for-game` on the [Social server][discord.social] with the details of your game.
Players will then be able to get in contact with you if they are interested in joining.

## GM Resources and Support

Please see [the GM Masterlist][resources.gm_masterlist] for a series of additional resources made specifically to help GMs.
