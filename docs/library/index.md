## Library How-Tos

### Searching for a Book

The online library has a variety of different ways to search for books. You can:

- [Browse by system](catalogue/all_systems)

!!! warning
    Please **don't** use the search bar at the top of the page, as it is currently not setup to index the library. Apologies for the inconvenience, but we are working on it!

    In the meantime, you can easily find books by title if you know the system they are for.

### Loaning a Book

To loan a book, you'll need to find it in the online library. Follow the guide above to find it. 

Once you've found the book, you'll need to click on it to open its page, where you should see a button called "Loan this item". 
If it's greyed out, that means the book is currently on loan to someone else, and we're not able to loan it to you at this time.

After you click the button, you'll be taken to a Google Form to fill out, and the NoDDSoc [Librarian](/committee/members) will be in touch shortly after to discuss collection.

### Returning a Book

You'll need to return any books you've borrowed from the Library by the end of the academic year. Please get in touch with our [Librarian](/committee/members) to arrange a drop-off time.

### Suggesting a Book

If there's a book we currently don't have, but that you think would be a great addition to the library, then please let us know by filling out [this form][forms.library_suggestion].

Please note that if a book falls under the Yellow or Red classifications, we will not be able to purchase it. If this is the case, we'll try to get in touch to let you know.

!!! note
    We can no longer purchase any books or products published by Wizards of the Coast, because we have classified them as Yellow!

### Donating a Book

A large part of our library is built from donations from our members. If you have a book you'd like to donate, please get in touch with our [Librarian](/committee/members) to discuss your donation.

### Reviewing a Book

If you have borrowed a book from the library, we'd love to hear what your thoughts were on it! There is a button titled "Leave a review" on every book's page, which will take you to a Google Form to complete.

We'd love to show your review on the library website, but if you'd prefer to keep it private (or be credited as anonymous), please let us know in the form!

## Book Classifications

While most of our books are perfectly normal TTRPG books, there are a few that have to be restricted because of their content. Every book has one of the following classifications:

- **Green:** there are no restrictions on this book.
- **Yellow:** this book can be loaned out and listed on the online library, but we are not allowed to purchase any more copies of it with society funds.
- **Red:** this book contains obscene content, and can only be loaned out on direct request to the [Librarian](/committee/members). It will not be listed on the online library, and we cannot purchase any more copies of it.

If a book is considered obscene in the TTRPG community, it is highly unlikely that we will have a copy of it available.
