# Library Welcome Desk

Welcome to the NoDDSoc Library! 
This is an online directory of all the books we have available for loan. 
Please read the guides below to learn how to use the library.

Please get in contact with our [Librarian](/committee/members) if you have any questions.

## Searching for a Book

The online library has a variety of different ways to search for books. You can:

- [Browse by system](/library/catalogue)

!!! warning
    Please **don't** use the search bar at the top of the page, as it is currently not setup to index the library. 
    Apologies for the inconvenience, but we are working on it!

    In the meantime, you can easily find books by title if you know the system they are for.

## Loaning a Book

To loan a book, you'll need to find it in the online library. Follow the guide above to find it. 

Once you've found the book, you'll need to click on it to open its page, where you should see a button called "Loan this item". 
If it's greyed out, that means the book is currently on loan to someone else, and we're not able to loan it to you at this time.

After you click the button, you'll be taken to a Google Form to fill out, and the NoDDSoc [Librarian](/committee/members) will be in touch shortly after to discuss collection.

## Returning a Book

You'll need to return any books you've borrowed from the Library by the end of the academic year. 
Please get in touch with our [Librarian](/committee/members) to arrange a drop-off time.

## Suggesting a Book

If there's a book we currently don't have, but that you think would be a great addition to the library, then please let us know by filling out [this form][forms.library_suggestion].

Please note that if a book falls under the [Yellow or Red classifications](/games/classes), we will not be able to purchase it. 
If this is the case, we'll try to get in touch to let you know.

!!! warning
    We can no longer purchase any books or products published by Wizards of the Coast!

## Donating a Book

A large part of our library is built from donations from our members. 
If you have a book you'd like to donate, please get in touch with our [Librarian](/committee/members) to discuss your donation.

## Reviewing a Book

If you have borrowed a book from the library, we'd love to hear what your thoughts were on it! 
There is a button titled "Leave a review" on every book's page, which will take you to a Google Form to complete.

We'd love to show your review on the library website, but if you'd prefer to keep it private (or be credited as anonymous), please let us know in the form!
