# Game Classification

## Green Games

Most of the library and the games we run are classified as Green, which means that they **do not contain sensitive or harmful content**. 

We have a variety of [Safety Tools](/safety/triggers) that GMs and players can use to ensure they feel comfortable with everything that happens in-game.

!!! info "Library Rules"
    All Green books are listed on our [online library](/library) and can be loaned freely.

## Yellow Games

A game is classified as Yellow if:

- It contains sensitive or harmful content, but can be avoided or presented in a reasonable way, or
- The developers have a history of problematic behaviour that we don't necessarily want to support (this only affects the purchase of new books)

If the latter is the case, our [Inclusions Officers](/committee/members) may need to talk with the GM about the game before it is run, or be in attendance of all sessions. 
Please be assured that we will ensure all players in a Yellow game feel safe and comfortable.

!!! info "Library Rules"
    We cannot display Yellow books on our online library, and you can only loan them by direct request to the [Librarian](/committee/members).

    We also cannot purchase any new Yellow books, but we can accept donations of them.

## Red Games

If a game is classified as Red, it is because:

- Bigoted ideals are baked into the system, in a way that cannot be realistically avoided, or
- The developers have long histories of bigotry and/or far-right ties, with no record of apology or redemption

We cannot allow you to run these games within NoDDSoc under any circumstances.

!!! info "Library Rules"
    We cannot display any Red books that we may have, nor can we loan them to you.
