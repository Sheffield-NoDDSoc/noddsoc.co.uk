# Card System

The Card System is a safety tools that players can use to indicate if they're feeling distressed or uncomfortable during a game.
Cards can also be used by the GM if they notice a player is struggling, or if they need to take a break themselves.
Please remember to treat anyone who uses a card with respect, regardless of why they've used the cards.

## Yellow Card

The Yellow Card is a warning that a player is getting uncomfortable or feels at risk of distress.

If you're the GM, you should try to steer the game away from the topic, or take a break if necessary. 
You should also check in with the player to make sure they're okay.

As a player, if you notice someone has used the Yellow Card, please be respectful and avoid continuing the topic.

## Red Card

The Red Card is an emergency and signals that a player needs the game to stop **immediately**.
A player should use this card if they're suffering a panic attack, flashback, or any other severe distress.
This is not to be used lightly, but we'd prefer you use it too hastily than not at all!

Once used, the GM should stop the game immediately and call a break.
Your GM should then check in with you to make sure you're okay, and may also speak to an [Inclusions Officer](/committee/members) if needed.
