# Lines & Veils

Lines & Veils is one of our primary safety tools. It's a spreadsheet derived from our [Trigger List](/safety/triggers#trigger-list), and whether each trigger will be present/allowed in a game. It's a great way for GMs to specify exactly which triggers *will* be present, as well as for players and GMs to specify content they don't want in-game.

It also allows players to preemptively specify their character's involvement in romantic/sexual relationships during the game, as well as whether they're happy with participating in PvP. 

## Template

You can find a template for the Lines and Veils tool [here][templates.lines&veils]. You'll need to copy the template to your own Google Drive before you can edit it. You can also download it as an Excel spreadsheet if you prefer.

## How To Use It

Lines & Veils is pretty simple to use. The template includes instructions for you, but here's a quick overview for convenience:

- **Lines:** if checked, this content will _not_ be present in-game
- **Veils:** if checked, this content will not be _explored_ in-game, but _may be present off-screen or faded to black_
- **Wants:** if checked, this content _will_ be present and explored in-game
- **Unchecked:** if a trigger is unchecked, a player or GM may bring it up if relevant
