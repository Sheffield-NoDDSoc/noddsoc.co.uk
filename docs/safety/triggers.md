# Triggers & Squicks

**Triggers** are concepts or things that can cause someone to experience severe distress or panic, or to relive past trauma.
It's incredibly important that we take care to avoid these topics where possible, and to ensure people are properly warned if they do come up in conversation.

**Squicks** are less severe than triggers, but can still cause discomfort or distress. 
While a certain topic might only be a squick for one person, it could be a trigger for another.
For that reason, we expect our members to use the same level of caution with squicks as they would with triggers.

You can read more about triggers and squicks in our [Etiquette Guides](/safety/etiquette).

## Triggers in the Social Server

If any of the topics in our [trigger list](#trigger-list) are mentioned in the [Social Server][discord.social], we have to ask that you make sure to put a spoiler around it and add a trigger warning.
You can do that like this:

```markdown
CW: Abuse
|| This is a message about abuse. ||
```

The `||` around your message will hide it from a person until they click on it. 
This gives them the opportunity to read your content warning and decide whether to read the rest of your message.
