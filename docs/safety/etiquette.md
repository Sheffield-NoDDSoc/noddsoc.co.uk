## Social Server Etiquette

1. **Wheaton's Law:** don't be a jerk.
2. **Discrimination:** we have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of discrimination (incl. but not limited to: racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc.).
3. **Content & Spoiler Warnings:**
    1. Please avoid discussing sensitive or potentially triggering topics in our general spaces.
    2. If you have to discuss something triggering, please keep it in the designated content warning channels. Also see [here](/safety/triggers#triggers-in-the-social-server) for how to properly add a content warning.
    3. Spoilers for popular media should be kept in our spoiler channels, and should be tagged in the same way as above.
4. **Nicknames:** we encourage members to use part of their real (preferred) name in their nicknames. Inappropriate nicknames will be removed.
5. **NSFW Content:**
    1. The vast majority of NSFW or suggestive content is not allowed anywhere in the Social Server.
    2. We define "NSFW content" as anything that is sexually explicit and does not fall under these categories:
        1. Artistic or non-sexual nudity
        2. Non-explicit, **consensual** sexual contact in-game (e.g. "You succeeded in seducing the guard, you share a bed for the night and have a *lovely* time.")
    3. Our [Inclusions Officers](/committee/members) have the last say if anything is too racy for NoDDSoc.

Breaking these rules may result in being temporarily or permanently removed from NoDDSoc, depending on the severity of the breach.

Please note that these rules are subject to change at any time, and any member of [Committee](/committee/members) has the final say on disputes. 

## Game Etiquette Guides

In order to make sure everyone feels included and welcome in NoDDSoc, we have a set of rules that everyone is expected to follow. We have two different guides depending on whether you are a GM or a player:

- **GMs:** [GM Etiquette Guide][etiquette.gm]
- **Players:** [Player Etiquette Guide][etiquette.player]
