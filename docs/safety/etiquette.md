# Member Etiquette Guides

In order to make sure everyone feels included and welcome in NoDDSoc, we have a set of rules that everyone is expected to follow. We have two different guides depending on whether you are a GM or a player:

- **GMs:** [GM Etiquette Guide][etiquette.gm]
- **Players:** [Player Etiquette Guide][etiquette.player]
