# Script Changes

This is a safety tool that players can use if they need to adjust the way the game plays out.
They are a set of phrases that players can say (sometimes woven into sentences) to tell the GM how they'd like to change the current scene.

## Pause

Take a break from an intense scene, or to clarify or discuss what's happening in the story.

## Rewind

Rewinds the story back before a piece of content entered the scene. 
This allows the group to narrate a different course of action to the one that led to the rewind.

## Fast-Forward

Allows a player to skip over a scene that they may find distressing or uncomfortable.

## Frame-by-Frame

Slows down an intense or fast-paced scene to allow players to process what's happening and make it easier to pause.
