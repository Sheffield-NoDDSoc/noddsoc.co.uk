# Joining Committee

Our [Committee](introduction.md) is elected annually at an AGM just before the Easter break. We typically have our handovers just after, where the new Committee take over from the old Committee. 

## Annual General Meeting

We hold our AGM within the AGM season (as determined by the SU overlords) every academic year. Here, every role is up for election, and you'll have the chance to nominate yourself for a role. 

## Emergency General Meeting

Sometimes, not every role is filled at the AGM. When this happens, we will hold an EGM at some point in the academic year to try and fill the rest of the roles. There's no specific time that EGMs are held, because they can be called by Committee at any time.

If one of the [Core Committee](introduction.md#core-committee) roles is not filled at an AGM, then an EGM will be held very soon after, because we are required to fill these roles by the Students' Union.

## Election Process

The election process is the same for both AGMs and EGMs. This is a quick rundown of how the election process works:

### Step 0: Eligibility

There are a few eligibility requirements that each candidate must meet in order to join Committee:

1. You must be a member of the society for the current academic year
2. You must be a Full Member of the Students' Union (see [the SU byelaws](https://assets-cdn.sums.su/SH/PDF_Files/BYE_LAWS_12_05_22.pdf) for what this means)

### Step 1: Nominate Yourself

In order to join the Committee, you have to nominate yourself. This is done by filling out a form that will be linked in the announcement for the AGM/EGM. You can nominate yourself for as many roles as you like, but you can only hold one at a time.

When you submit your nomination, you'll be asked to submit a manifesto. This is a brief message about yourself and why you want to join Committee.

Nominations are typically only open for a short period of time (up to a week for AGMs), so make sure you keep an eye on the [Social Server][discord.social] for an announcement when they open!

### Step 2: Give a Speech (Optional)

When the time comes for the AGM/EGM, you'll be given the chance to give a short speech to everyone who's attending the election. 

Alternatively if you can't attend/don't feel comfortable, you can ask a member of Committee to read out the manifesto you submitted when you nominated yourself!

### Step 3: Voting Opens

After all the candidates have had the opportunity to give a speech, or have their manifesto read out, then voting will open. This will be a Google Form sent to the [Social Server][discord.social].

Once open, you'll have 24 hours to cast your vote. NoDDSoc uses the [Single Transferable Voting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote), so you'll be asked for rank each candidate for each role in order from most preferred to least preferred.

**Note:** please make sure you enter your registration number correctly. If you give us an invalid registration number (or you don't have a valid membership), then __we cannot count your vote__!

### Step 4: Counting Votes

Once voting has closed, our Counting Officer will count all the votes and check for valid memberships. Once this is done, the Returning Officer will announce the results in the [Social Server][discord.social].

### Step 5: Handovers

Once the new Committee have been confirmed, it's time for the old Committee to handover to the new Committee. This is typically done by arranging a 1:1 meeting between the newly elected Committee member, and their predecessor.

### Step 6: SU Training

All [Core Committee](introduction.md#core-committee) roles are required to undergo training from the Students' Union for their role. [Extended Committee](introduction.md#extended-committee) will also be invited to attend SU training, but this is not mandatory.
