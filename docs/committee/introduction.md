# What We Do

## Core Committee

The Core Committee are the four roles that every society is required to fill in order to keep operating. They are responsible for a lot of the basic duties of a society, such as managing an inbox, handling society funds and addressing inclusivity concerns.

### President

The President (sometimes called the Chair) is responsible for overseeing the society. Examples of their main duties are:

- Chairing meetings
- Representing NoDDSoc at the Students' Union, to other societies and to the public
- Ensuring NoDDSoc's [Constitution][constitution] is upheld
- Delegating tasks to other Committee members

### Secretary

NoDDSoc's Secretary is responsible for a lot of the society's bookkeeping and administrative needs. This includes things like:

- Managing the society's inbox
- Taking minutes at meetings
- Writing agendas for meetings
- Ensuring handover runs smoothly
- Managing NoDDSoc's AGMs and EGMs
- Managing room bookings for events, meetings and games

### Treasurer

The Treasurer looks after our finances, and is responsible for:

- Reimbursing Committee members for their NoDDSoc expenses
- Ensuring all NoDDSoc expenses are properly evidenced and accounted for
- Ensuring appropriate fees have been paid for events and society membership
- Informing the rest of Committee about the society's finances

### Inclusions Officers

Our Inclusions Officers are there to ensure NoDDSoc is a welcoming and inclusive space for all. While most societies are only required to have one Inclusions Officer, NoDDSoc has two to ensure there's always someone available to help. The Inclusions team are responsible for:

- Upholding NoDDSoc's [Etiquette Guides](/safety/etiquette)
- Managing our [Trigger List](/safety/triggers)
- Ensuring all events and games are accessible
- Ensuring games have an accurate and up-to-date trigger list
- Mediating disputes, both inside and outside games
- Updating and encouraging the use of safety tools, such as [Lines & Veils](/safety/lines_veils)

## Extended Committee

While the Core Committee take care of our basic needs, it's the Extended Committee's job to deal with everything else! While our roles aren't required by the Students' Union, we are just as important as the Core Committee!
